SDI contains an interpretable scale: zero represents the lowest income per capita, lowest educational attainment, and highest TFR observed across all GBD geographies from 1980 to 2015, and one represents the highest income per capita, highest educational attainment, and lowest TFR. This dataset provides tables with SDI values for all estimated GBD 2015 geographies for 1980â€“2015 and groupings by geography based on 2015 values.\n",
